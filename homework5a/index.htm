        <ul>
            <li>I used Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge</li>
            <li>a. For the four properties, each browser seems to show the appropriate information.</li>
            <li>b. The web browser name is the same in all three browsers. The web browser version and user agent is similar in Chrome and Edge
                with 7 version listings with the addition of Safari in the user agent. There is an extra Edge version listed in the Edge 
                browser while, Firefox only lists Windowsin its web browser verson and the user agent has Mozilla, Firefox, Gecko and 3
                versions of Windows.
            </li>
            <li>
                c. The only issue I see is that all the browser names are Netscape. As a result it does not specificaly say which browser
                is being used. So, either it does this because the Navigator object was named after "Netscape Navigator" or there is an
                error I can not detect. The properties that show the most useful information are the user agent and web browser version.
            </li>    
        </ul>
